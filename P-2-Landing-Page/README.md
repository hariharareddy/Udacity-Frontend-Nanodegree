# Landing Page Project
This is second project in the Udacity Frontend Nano Degree. It is all about manipulating Dom using JavaScript.
The Navigation should be built dynamically as an unordered list. Starting with empty ul and dynamically building navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.
The section is being viewed while scrolling through the page will be highlighted. When we click an item from the navigation menu, the link will scroll to the appropriate section smoothly.

# Instructions
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. 
This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

This project doesn't require any installation, you can clone my project using git clone and you can run my project by opening index.html file in any browser of your choice.

# Usage
Landing Page contains top navigation bar when users clicks on any menu, the page will scroll smoothly to the corresponding section. The section which is currently in view port has some styling 
applied to differentiate from other sections and the navbar menu will also be highlighted for better user experience.
